# services/gameplay

`pkgs/gizclaw/services/gameplay` owns the Gameplay catalog, player state, rewards, and digital assets. Gameplay configuration now belongs to a connection's RuntimeProfile; there is no separate GameRuleset resource.

## Ownership

Gameplay owns PetDef, BadgeDef, GameDef, Pet, points accounts, transactions, reward grants, badge progression, and game results. RuntimeProfile `resources.pet_defs`, `resources.voices`, `resources.game_defs`, and `resources.badge_defs` maps provide profile-local aliases. Each `gameplay.adoption.pool` entry references both a PetDef and Voice alias, while `gameplay.pet.games` uses GameDef aliases as direct keys.

Pet adoption resolves rules from the current connection's RuntimeProfile snapshot, stores the selected pool entry's Voice alias in the system Workspace, and records the RuntimeProfile name on the Pet and related state. PetDef contains no Voice ID or alias; it retains character/speaking style, PIXA, and behavior-to-animation bindings. The Pet system Workspace uses the built-in `pet-care` Workflow; `pet-care` does not need to appear in the RuntimeProfile `workflows` map.

A profile with no valid PetDef cannot adopt a Pet, and a GameDef not allowed by the current profile cannot submit a game result. Invalid aliases and reward references fail RuntimeProfile validation. Deleting a definition or RuntimeProfile does not cascade into existing Gameplay history.

## Pet identity and adoption retries

`runtime.adopt` accepts an optional caller-provided `id`. The ID is a durable Pet resource identity, not a separate operation-level idempotency key. A device that needs retry-safe adoption generates and persists a valid GizClaw custom ID before the first request, then reuses it after a timeout, disconnect, or other uncertain response.

Pet IDs are scoped by the authenticated Peer. The first successful adoption of `(peer, id)` creates one Pet, one system Workspace, one adoption transaction, and one points charge. An unaffordable attempt fails before reserving the ID or creating a Pet, Workspace, or transaction. Repeating a successful adoption under the same active RuntimeProfile returns the existing Pet, the current Points account, and the original adoption transaction without selecting another PetDef or writing again. A different `display_name` on the retry does not rename the Pet; callers use `server.pet.put` for that operation.

Different Peers may use the same textual Pet ID. Their globally named internal Workspaces remain distinct, and every Pet RPC resolves both the authenticated Peer and Pet ID. One Peer cannot address another Peer's Pet. The same Peer cannot reuse an ID across RuntimeProfiles or after deleting the Pet because retained adoption history continues to reserve it. Omitting `id` preserves Server-generated IDs and treats each successful call as a new adoption.

## Fixed Pet contract

Every Pet has the same `life`, `health`, `satiety`, `hygiene`, `mood`, and `energy` stats in the fixed 0..100 range. Adoption initializes every stat to 100 and progression to `experience = 0`, `level = 1`. The behavior contract is fixed to `feed`, `bathe`, `play`, and `heal`, which raise satiety, hygiene, mood, and health respectively. PetDef does not define stat or behavior semantics. Its `visual.bindings.behaviors` and `visual.bindings.states` bind the fixed contract to that PetDef's PIXA clips. `idle`, `sick`, `dead`, and optional `sleep` are state visuals, not Drive behaviors.

RuntimeProfile `gameplay.pet` defines time policy, the level curve, each fixed behavior's energy cost/stat delta, and each allowed GameDef's points/energy cost and model reward policy. Behaviors apply deltas capped at 100. A successful behavior grants `energy_cost / energy_per_pet_exp` EXP. Energy recovers passively with elapsed time and does not require sleep.

Care stats decay linearly by their configured hourly rates. Define normalized deficit as

$$
D(t)=\sum_i w_i\left(1-\frac{s_i(t)}{100}\right),\qquad s_i(t)=\max(0,s_i(0)-r_i t)
$$

The life loss over an elapsed interval is

$$
\Delta life=L_{max}\int_0^T D(t)^p\,dt
$$

where weights sum to 1 and $p>1$. Full care stats produce zero deficit and therefore no life loss; lower care stats accelerate life loss. The Server evaluates the piecewise analytic integral, so settlement depends on initial state and elapsed time rather than request frequency.

`server.pet.drive` accepts an empty Drive containing only `pet_id` as a Server-authoritative time tick. It settles the elapsed interval from `state_settled_at`, persists care decay, energy recovery, life loss, and the new checkpoint, and returns the updated Pet without creating a behavior, game result, cost, or reward. Successive new ticks compose to the same state as one tick over the same total interval. When the optional request-level idempotency key is present, retrying that same empty Drive does not settle time again; a new key or no key starts a new tick.

When life reaches zero, the Pet atomically enters `dead` at the formula-derived death checkpoint with an immutable `died_at`, so terminal state is also independent of tick frequency. Behavior and game-result Drives cannot target a dead Pet; an empty Drive returns its unchanged terminal snapshot.

EXP required for the next level is `ceil(base_exp + log_scale * ln(current_level))`, with `log_scale` bounded to `0..100` so level calculation remains bounded. Cumulative EXP is not consumed by leveling. Initial points, adoption weights/costs, and every Pet policy value come only from RuntimeProfile; Server config has no fallback.

Every game must be configured explicitly in both `resources.game_defs` and `gameplay.pet.games`; there is no default. Submitting an unconfigured game is an exact no-op: no time settlement, points/energy deduction, game result, reward-model call, EXP, or badge. A configured game validates resources before invoking the current connection's authorized model. The model can grant only Pet EXP and eligible badge EXP within configured maxima. Model failure or invalid output produces no gameplay write. An idempotency key prevents a successful result from charging, evaluating, or rewarding twice.

Gameplay uses Workspace ownership and the Pet domain relationship. It does not create extra roles or policy bindings. Adoption persists a Pet-to-Workspace binding independently of the active Pet row. Pet deletion atomically removes only that active row and writes one `kind=pet` PendingDeletion in the same gameplay SQL database; it retains the binding so the owner can continue listing and accessing the system Workspace under the original RuntimeProfile even after pending cleanup completes. No Workspace pending record is created. Points, badges, results, transactions, and reward-grant history are preserved.
