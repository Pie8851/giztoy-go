# Management

`Implementation file: peer_manager.go`

`peer_manager.go` Maintain the online peers currently visible to the Server, and provide peer operation portals for other GizClaw components.

| Documentation | Features included |
| --- | --- |
| `peer_manager.go` | Maintain online Peer and connection replacement; connect online, offline and forced disconnection; query connections and Peer runtime; ensure the existence of Peer resources; refresh devices, hardware, IMEI and labels through Peer RPC; coordinate concurrent updates of telemetry status. |

This prefix has server-perspective online connection indexing and cross-connection operations, but does not have a peer persistence model. The Peer resource itself belongs to `services/runtime/peer`.

| `allowService` / `allowActivePeerRole` | Determine Giznet service admission based on Peer role. |
| [`Manager.Peer`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/GizClaw/gizclaw-go@v0.0.0-20260707135347-b9bf1fb24b9f/pkgs/gizclaw#Manager.Peer) / [`PeerRuntime`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/GizClaw/gizclaw-go@v0.0.0-20260707135347-b9bf1fb24b9f/pkgs/gizclaw#Manager.PeerRuntime) | Query online connection or runtime snapshot. |
| [`Manager.EnsurePeer`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/GizClaw/gizclaw-go@v0.0.0-20260707135347-b9bf1fb24b9f/pkgs/gizclaw#Manager.EnsurePeer) | Ensure that the persistent Peer resource exists. |
| [`Manager.RefreshPeer`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/GizClaw/gizclaw-go@v0.0.0-20260707135347-b9bf1fb24b9f/pkgs/gizclaw#Manager.RefreshPeer) / `refreshPeer` | Via Peer RPC Pull device information and write changes back to the Peer resource. |
| `peerRPCConn` / `callPeerRPC` | Open Peer RPC stream and execute typed RPC call. |
| `retainTelemetryStatusLock` / `releaseTelemetryStatusLock` | Manage telemetry status and update the lock life cycle by public key. |
| `applyPeerRefreshInfo` / `applyPeerRefreshIdentifiers` | Merge RPC refresh response into the persistent Peer model. |

Connection activation reserves its public key under the Manager lock, ensures the durable Peer generation without holding the global lock, and publishes the exact connection only while that reservation remains current. The durable ensure revalidates that reservation while holding the per-Peer record lock, so an activation waiting behind self-delete cannot recreate the deleted record. A reservation without a published connection is offline. An existing generation stays available while its replacement is being ensured; forced offline clears that generation without discarding the replacement reservation, and transport service loops start only after the new connection is published. Registration updates are accepted only for the exact active connection and never recreate a missing entry. A connection-scoped self-delete publishes a per-Peer deleting state under the Manager lock, performs the durable store mutation without holding the global Manager lock, and then conditionally removes or rolls back only that same connection generation. Replacement activation, registration, and server-initiated Peer RPC reject the deleting generation, while unrelated Peers remain available.

## Device metadata ownership

`client.info.get` refreshes only `HardwareInfo` (`hardware_revision`, `manufacturer`, and `model`). `client.identifiers.get` refreshes `DeviceIdentifiers` (`sn`, `imeis`, and `labels`). The server-owned profile fields `name` and `emoji` are changed through `server.info.put` and are not overwritten by reverse refresh. Names must be valid UTF-8 and at most 256 bytes; emoji values must be valid UTF-8 and at most 64 bytes.

Friends read these text profile fields through `server.friend.info.get`. The method requires an existing caller-scoped friend relation and returns no binary avatar data.
