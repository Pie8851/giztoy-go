# Telemetry API

`api/proto/telemetry/peer_telemetry.proto` Defines the telemetry event wire format sent by Peer to Server. It is a high-frequency one-way event stream, not an RPC method, and not an Admin HTTP resource.

## Data path

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Peer
    participant Conn as Giznet Peer connection
    participant Decoder as Telemetry decoder
    participant Service as Peer Telemetry service
    participant Store as Metrics store
    participant Admin as Admin HTTP

    Peer->>Conn: telemetry protobuf packet
    Conn->>Decoder: protocol + payload
    Decoder->>Service: typed telemetry event
    Service->>Store: append/update metrics
    Admin->>Service: query latest/aggregate
    Service-->>Admin: telemetry view
```

Telemetry Protobuf owns the wire fields reported by the device. Metrics store has save and query semantics; Admin HTTP has a response contract for administrators. Do not directly use the storage model as a telemetry wire message for convenience, and do not let the device depend on the Admin response DTO.

## Design rules

- The high frequency field should remain compact, stable and backward compatible.
- New fields must have explicit units, time semantics, and default values; they cannot just rely on guesswork from Go annotations.
- Decoder treats malformed or out-of-limit input as untrustworthy boundaries.
- Aggregation, retention and query filtering belong to service/store and not to wire schema.
- Regenerate Go and JavaScript telemetry code after Schema changes, and verify the real packet decode and service ingestion.
