# api overview

The root directory `api/` is the source of truth for GizClaw’s external agreement and shared data contract. This defines "what the two parties exchange" and does not implement authorization, storage, service lifecycle or domain business.

`pkgs/gizclaw/api/`, JavaScript SDK and C SDK are the generated results of these contracts or adapters that adhere to the wire format, not another source of definition.
