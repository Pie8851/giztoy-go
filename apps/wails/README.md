# GizClaw Desktop

`apps/wails` is the new GizClaw desktop shell. It replaces the old
CLI-hosted Admin UI and Play UI surfaces with a Wails app that stores local
contexts outside the WebView and talks to GizClaw servers from the frontend over
WebRTC.

## Runtime Boundary

- The Go backend manages local context files and selected UI state.
- The Go backend does not call GizClaw server APIs or proxy RPC/API requests.
- The frontend receives the selected context, signaling URL, and private key
  material from Wails at runtime and keeps it in memory.
- Browser persistence such as `localStorage` and IndexedDB must not be used for
  private key material.

## Local State

By default the app stores state under the OS user config directory:

```text
gizclaw-desktop/
├── contexts/
│   ├── current -> <context-name>
│   └── <context-name>/
│       ├── config.yaml
│       └── identity.key
└── state.json
```

For tests and local development, set `GIZCLAW_DESKTOP_CONFIG_HOME` to isolate
this directory.

## Development

```sh
cd apps/wails
go mod tidy
cd ../..
npm install
npm --prefix apps/wails/frontend run build
go test ./apps/wails/...
```

The shell provides context selection plus full Admin and Play views. Admin API
requests use generated clients over WebRTC service fetch, and Play requests use
generated peer RPC types over WebRTC.
