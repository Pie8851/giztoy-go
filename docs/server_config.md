# GizClaw Server Config

The GizClaw server loads its workspace configuration from `config.yaml`.
The command server parses this file through `cmd/internal/server.ConfigFile`
and wires named storage backends and logical stores from it. Services use
conventional logical store names from `stores`; service sections are only for
business settings such as TTLs and system task generators.

## Example

```yaml
# Local bind address. WebRTC ICE UDP and the single TCP mux use this address.
# serve-to-clients controls whether clients may use peer HTTP routes directly.
listen: 0.0.0.0:9820

# Client-facing server address. LAN deployments should set this to the address
# clients can actually reach. It is used by client contexts and advertised in
# WebRTC ICE UDP host candidates when the host is a concrete IP.
endpoint: 192.168.1.20:9820

# Direct peer/public HTTP routes on the TCP mux are opt-in. Keep this disabled
# for deployments that route device access through an edge ingress.
serve-to-clients: true

# Optional edge-node bootstrap peers. Listed public keys are created or updated
# as active peers with role edge-node during server initialization.
edge-nodes:
  - "J8wzYhsJ2xehy4JnuR1f5tF9KX3hTzP7yGkFvpS7hTsg"

# Optional admin public key. When set, admin HTTP/RPC calls must authenticate as
# this key. Leave empty only for local development or tests that inject runtime
# admin identity another way.
admin-public-key: "AzmxuX8okxz4eLD1s5qfpNfD68B35Kpsagqmn6dRydfS"

## Transport Config

The command server uses one local bind address, one client-facing endpoint, and
an explicit client serving mode:

```yaml
listen: 0.0.0.0:9820
endpoint: 192.168.1.20:9820
serve-to-clients: true
```

`edge-nodes` is an optional list of peer public keys. On startup, each key is
stored as an active `edge-node` peer, preserving existing peer metadata when the
peer already exists. Edge-node peers may open `ServiceEdgeRPC`; they do not gain
admin HTTP access.

Edge peer assignment RPCs use the configured server identity and `endpoint` as
the local route target. Assignments are stored locally under the peer store
namespace and are not synchronized across a wider mesh.

Binding and dialing direction:

- `listen/tcp` is one shared TCP mux port. It is not split into separate public
  and private HTTP ports.
- `serve-to-clients: true` lets clients use the TCP mux peer HTTP face directly,
  including `/server-info`, `/login`, the fixed WebRTC signaling path
  `/webrtc/v1/offer`, caller-scoped `/me/...` routes, and the Peer
  OpenAI-compatible `/openai/v1/...` prefix.
- `serve-to-clients: false` keeps the TCP mux and HTTP handler active for
  server ingress and WebRTC ICE TCP, but client-facing peer HTTP routes require
  private ingress identity. `/login` only issues a session after the assertion
  maps to an active private-ingress peer role (`admin`, or the current
  server-side role used for non-device ingress peers), and subsequent
  `/server-info`, signaling, `/me/...`, and `/openai/v1/...` requests must
  present that session.
  Peer API, Peer OpenAI-compatible API, and Admin API handlers remain available
  over authenticated `gizhttp` service streams.
- `listen/udp` serves WebRTC ICE UDP.
- `endpoint` is the public `host:port` clients use for server HTTP/signaling
  and peer setup. When the host is a concrete IP, it is also advertised in
  WebRTC ICE UDP host candidates.

Defaults:

- `listen`: `0.0.0.0:9820`
- `endpoint`: defaults to `listen` when omitted.
- `serve-to-clients`: `false`; local development and e2e templates enable it
  explicitly.

## Logging Config

The server always writes text logs to stderr. Set `log.level` to `debug`,
`info`, `warn`, or `error` to control the minimum emitted level.

Volc TLS forwarding is enabled only when `log.volc.enabled` is true. When
enabled, `endpoint`, `region`, `topic_id`, `access_key_id`, and
`access_key_secret` are required after environment variable expansion.

The server logging config intentionally does not expose stderr format, caller
source, Volc filename, shard hash, nanosecond timestamp, or alternate auth-mode
knobs. Those are internal sink details.

## CLI Context Config

CLI contexts use the server `endpoint` value. See [context_config.md](context_config.md)
for the context file schema and dialing behavior.

## Field Notes

- `storage` contains physical backends. Currently supported `kind` values are
  `keyvalue`, `vecstore`, `objectstore`, and `sql`. Local files are exposed as
  an `objectstore` backend through `kind: objectstore` with an `fs` config.
- `stores` contains logical stores. Logical key/value stores should normally
  share a physical KV backend and isolate records with `prefix`.
- Logical object stores use `storage` plus `prefix` so multiple asset classes
  can share one physical object storage backend.
- Services use conventional logical store names directly from `stores`.
  Configuration should not repeat those names in service sections.
- Core services expect these logical store names when `storage`/`stores` are
  configured: `peers`, `credentials`, `firmwares`, `minimax-tenants`, `voices`,
  `workspaces`, `workflows`, and `acl`.
- Optional resource services are wired when their conventional logical stores
  exist: `firmware-assets`, `agenthost`, `contacts`, `friend-requests`,
  `friends`, `friend-groups`, `friend-group-members`, `friend-group-messages`, and
  `friend-group-message-assets`.
- Gameplay catalog services are wired from `game-rulesets`, `pet-defs`,
  `badge-defs`, and `game-defs`. Pet definition and badge pixa files
  use `gameplay-assets`. Peer-owned pet, badge, points, game result,
  transaction, and reward grant state uses the `gameplay-db` SQL store.
- `agenthost` is optional for the server itself, but workspace agents such as
  Flowcraft should configure it as an object store so AgentHost can prepare
  per-workspace runtime prefixes and local runtime directories when supported
  by the object-store backend.
- `contacts` stores current-peer address-book records. Contact objects are
  external contact data such as display name and phone number; they are not peer
  friend relationships.
- `friend-requests` stores friend request records, while `friends` stores
  accepted peer friend relationships.
- `friends.friend_otp_ttl` controls how long the 6-digit friend OTP reported by
  the target device through peerrun can be used for friend request creation.
- `friend-groups`, `friend-group-members`, and `friend-group-messages` store
  friend group metadata, membership rows, and friend group message metadata
  separately so list pagination and cleanup can be implemented independently.
- `friend-group-message-assets` stores friend group message audio objects.
  Message records should store relative `audio_path` values under this logical
  object store, never absolute host filesystem paths.
- `friend_groups.message_default_ttl` is used when a friend group message send request omits
  TTL. `friend_groups.message_max_ttl` bounds user-provided TTL values.
- `friend_groups.message_cleanup_interval` controls the background task that removes
  expired friend group message metadata and deletes the referenced audio objects. The
  cleanup task should tolerate already-missing audio objects.
- `friend_groups.message_max_audio_bytes` limits the decoded audio payload accepted by
  friend group message send before writing bytes to the configured object store.
- `endpoint` is the only command-server transport binding field. It must be a
  `host:port` value and is used for both TCP HTTP/signaling and UDP ICE.
- Asset services should use object-store operations such as get, put, delete,
  delete-prefix, and list. They should not require directory creation or rename
  semantics that are awkward for OSS-style backends.
