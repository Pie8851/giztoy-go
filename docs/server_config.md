# GizClaw Server Config

The GizClaw server loads its workspace configuration from `config.yaml`.
The command server parses this file through `cmd/internal/server.ConfigFile`
and wires named storage backends and logical stores from it. Services use
conventional logical store names from `stores`; service sections are only for
business settings such as TTLs and system task generators.

## Example

```yaml
# Single public endpoint the GizClaw server binds.
# The same host:port serves HTTP public APIs and WebRTC signaling over TCP,
# and WebRTC ICE over UDP. Signaling is fixed at /webrtc/v1/offer.
endpoint: 0.0.0.0:9820

# Optional admin public key. When set, admin HTTP/RPC calls must authenticate as
# this key. Leave empty only for local development or tests that inject runtime
# admin identity another way.

# Physical storage backends. These are concrete persistence engines.
storage:
  # In-memory key/value backend. Useful for tests and throwaway local servers.
  memory:
    kind: keyvalue
    memory: {}

  # Persistent Badger key/value backend.
  main-kv:

  # style driver should expose the same object-store semantics.
  local-assets:
    kind: objectstore
    fs:

```

## Transport Config

The command server uses a single endpoint:

```yaml
endpoint: 0.0.0.0:9820
```

Binding direction:

- `endpoint/tcp` serves server-public HTTP APIs, including `/server-info`,
  `/login`, and the fixed WebRTC signaling path `/webrtc/v1/offer`.
- `endpoint/udp` serves WebRTC ICE UDP.

The server config no longer supports `host`, `listen`, `public-api-port`,
`noise-udp-port`, `ice-port`, or `cipher-mode`. `LoadConfig` rejects those
fields so stale split-port configs fail fast instead of silently advertising a
wrong public endpoint.

Default endpoint:

- `0.0.0.0:9820`

## CLI Context Config

CLI contexts use the same endpoint model. See [context_config.md](context_config.md)
for the context file schema and dialing behavior.

## Field Notes

- `storage` contains physical backends. Currently supported `kind` values are
  `keyvalue`, `vecstore`, `objectstore`, and `sql`. Local files are exposed as
  an `objectstore` backend through `kind: objectstore` with an `fs` config.
- `stores` contains logical stores. Logical key/value stores should normally
  share a physical KV backend and isolate records with `prefix`.
- Logical object stores use `storage` plus `prefix` so multiple asset classes
  can share one physical object storage backend.
- Services use conventional logical store names directly from `stores`.
  Configuration should not repeat those names in service sections.
- Core services expect these logical store names when `storage`/`stores` are
  configured: `peers`, `credentials`, `firmwares`, `minimax-tenants`, `voices`,
  `workspaces`, `workflows`, and `acl`.
- Optional resource services are wired when their conventional logical stores
  exist: `firmware-assets`, `agenthost`, `pet-species`,
  `pet-species-assets`, `badges`, `badge-assets`, `pets`, `rewards`,
  `wallets`, `contacts`, `friend-requests`, `friends`, `friend-groups`,
  `friend-group-members`, `friend-group-messages`, and
  `friend-group-message-assets`.
- `system_tasks.*.generator` values must use `model/<model-id>`. The model id
  must match an admin `Model` resource, such as `qwen-flash`.
- `gameplay.pet_adopt_point_cost` controls the point cost charged by
  `pet.adopt`; a negative value disables the adoption charge.
- `firmwares`, `pet-species`, and `badges` each use a KV metadata store plus a
  separate object store for uploaded binary assets.
- `agenthost` is optional for the server itself, but workspace agents such as
  Flowcraft should configure it as an object store so AgentHost can prepare
  per-workspace runtime prefixes and local runtime directories when supported
  by the object-store backend.
- `pets` and `rewards` hold peer-facing JSON records in logical KV stores.
- `wallets` is SQL-backed because wallet balance updates and transaction
  inserts must commit atomically.
- `contacts` stores current-peer address-book records. Contact objects are
  external contact data such as display name and phone number; they are not peer
  friend relationships.
- `friend-requests` stores friend request records, while `friends` stores
  accepted peer friend relationships.
- `friends.friend_otp_ttl` controls how long the 6-digit friend OTP reported by
  the target device through peerrun can be used for friend request creation.
- `friend-groups`, `friend-group-members`, and `friend-group-messages` store
  friend group metadata, membership rows, and friend group message metadata
  separately so list pagination and cleanup can be implemented independently.
- `friend-group-message-assets` stores friend group message audio objects.
  Message records should store relative `audio_path` values under this logical
  object store, never absolute host filesystem paths.
- `friend_groups.message_default_ttl` is used when a friend group message send request omits
  TTL. `friend_groups.message_max_ttl` bounds user-provided TTL values.
- `friend_groups.message_cleanup_interval` controls the background task that removes
  expired friend group message metadata and deletes the referenced audio objects. The
  cleanup task should tolerate already-missing audio objects.
- `friend_groups.message_max_audio_bytes` limits the decoded audio payload accepted by
  friend group message send before writing bytes to the configured object store.
- `endpoint` is the only command-server transport binding field. It must be a
  `host:port` value and is used for both TCP HTTP/signaling and UDP ICE.
- Asset services should use object-store operations such as get, put, delete,
  delete-prefix, and list. They should not require directory creation or rename
  semantics that are awkward for OSS-style backends.
