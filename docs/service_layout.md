# GizClaw Surface Layout

This document describes user-facing API surfaces. Transport service IDs are
named only when they are part of the public SDK contract.

## Transport Services

`Service*` names are reserved for RPC and HTTP surfaces carried over reliable
giznet service streams:

```text
ServicePeerRPC    = 0x00
ServicePeerHTTP   = 0x01
ServicePeerOpenAI = 0x02
ServiceAdminHTTP  = 0x10
ServiceEdgeRPC    = 0x31
```

Event streams and media streams are not listed as services here. They are
defined in `docs/event_stream.md`.

## Doc Style

- Business RPC-style methods use dotted names:
  `surface.resource.method`.
- Multiple methods on one business resource use braces:
  `resource.{list,get,create,put,delete}`.
- HTTP endpoints use path-first notation:
  `/path OPERATION[, OPERATION]`.
- Custom HTTP verbs are listed under their resource path as subtree items:
  `@verb`.

Peer-reported status updates are projected from telemetry event packets into
`server.status.get`; there is no peer-facing `server.status.put` RPC method.

## Peer RPC Surface

The peer RPC surface uses `ServicePeerRPC`.

## Peer HTTP Surface

The peer HTTP surface uses `ServicePeerHTTP`.

```text
/server-info GET
/login POST
/webrtc/v1/offer POST
/me GET
/me/status GET, PUT
/me/runtime GET
```

## Peer OpenAI-Compatible HTTP Surface

The peer OpenAI-compatible HTTP surface uses `ServicePeerOpenAI`. It exposes
OpenAI-compatible HTTP routes over the peer connection and is separate from the
peer HTTP bootstrap/signaling surface.

When the optional peer/public TCP HTTP face is enabled, the same
OpenAI-compatible handler is mounted under `/openai/v1/...`. The underlying
conn-service contract remains `ServicePeerOpenAI`; these routes are not part of
the Peer HTTP schema.

## Edge RPC Surface

The edge RPC surface uses `ServiceEdgeRPC`. It is accepted only from active
peers with role `edge-node`; admin peers continue to use the admin surface and
do not gain this service.

```text
Edge RPC
├── edge.peer.lookup
├── edge.peer.assign
└── edge.route.resolve
```

`edge.peer.assign` creates or refreshes a local peer assignment for the target
peer on the current server. The assignment record contains `peer_public_key`,
`server_public_key`, `server_endpoint`, `role`, `version`, and `updated_at`.
`edge.peer.lookup` and `edge.route.resolve` read the local assignment store; this
surface does not perform mesh-wide route synchronization.

## Admin HTTP Surface

The admin HTTP surface uses `ServiceAdminHTTP`.
